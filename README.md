jquery-plugins
==============

This is a collection of simple jquery plugins each providing a single fonctionnality.

While all those functions already exists in various libraries, the purpose was to make those plugins as simple, straighforward, lightweight and easy to use as possible.

This code is public domain, do what you want with it (except killing otters, because who doesn't like otters).

* tagifier

Transforms an input into a tag-entry field, allowing multiple tags, edition, deletion, and a nice looking interface.

* if_img_data_uri

Check whether the browser knows how to handle images as data-uris, and call the proper callback

* loading_on_submit

Loads an overlay on top of a form when submitting to show the loading status and avoid further modification that would not be taken into account. Also provides a simple 'start'/'stop' api (for exemple to show the overlay on your own events)


* size-limit

Given an input or textarea, limit the size of the text that can be written in it and optionnaly update a counter to show how much space is left for the user
